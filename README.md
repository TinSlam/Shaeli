# Shaeli
Shaeli is an object-oriented programming language that can convert the input code to C code which can then be used with other C files
to make object-oriented programming possible in environments that do not support higher level languages. <br />
It can also be used as a standalone programming language.

# How to use
Put the file containing the entry point in the "Input" folder. <br />
Run the "GenerateOutput.bat" file to compile your code. An executable file will be generated in the "Output" directory. <br />
Or alternatively run "GenerateCFiles.bat" to convert your code to C code. The generated files will be inside the "Output" directory.<br />
